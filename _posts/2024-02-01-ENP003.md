# How do otters protect salt marshes from erosion? 水獭如何保护盐沼免受侵蚀？

**Sea otters inadvertently protect the vegetation that binds sandy shorelines together.**
海獭无意中保护了将桑迪海岸线连接在一起的植被。

Sea otters are helping to keep the shores of a central Californian estuary from crumbling into the ocean. They act as erosion control by feasting on shore crabs — crustaceans whose burrowing and vegetation-munching habits contribute to unstable salt-marsh banks.
海獭正在帮助防止加州中部河口的海岸崩塌入海。它们通过吃海岸(上的植被)来控制侵蚀。海蟹是一种甲壳类动物，它们的穴居和咀嚼植物的习惯导致了盐沼河岸的不稳定。

By the twentieth century, humans had hunted sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) nearly to extinction for their fur. But conservation efforts have helped population sizes to increase, and otters are re-establishing themselves in their historical haunts, including in the salt marshes of Monterey Bay’s Elkhorn Slough. Moreover, in marsh creeks with high numbers of sea otters, erosion rates are lower than when there were fewer sea otters, researchers report today in *Nature*[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00217-2#ref-CR1).
到了世纪，人类为了获取海獭的皮毛而猎杀海獭（Enhydra lutris），几乎使其灭绝。但是保护工作帮助了人口的增加，水獭正在它们历史上经常出没的地方重新建立自己的地位，包括蒙特雷湾埃尔克霍恩斯劳的盐沼。此外，研究人员今天在《自然》杂志上报道，在海獭数量较多的沼泽小溪中，侵蚀率低于海獭数量较少的时候。

“It’s remarkable when you think about it,” says Jane Watson, a community ecologist at Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo, Canada. “You can have a single animal, the sea otter, come in and through predation actually mitigate the effects of erosion.”
加拿大纳奈莫市温哥华岛大学的社区生态学家简·沃森说：“仔细想想，这是很了不起的。”“你可以让一种动物，海獭，进来，通过捕食实际上减轻侵蚀的影响。”

## Natural vegetation protectors 天然植被保护剂

Salt marshes provide crucial habitats for wildlife but are threatened globally. Several factors, such as increased water flow and sea-level rise, contribute to the amount of erosion in Elkhorn Slough — estimated at around 30 centimetres per year. Striped shore crabs (*Pachygrapsus crassipes*) also play a part by eating the roots of pickleweed (*Salicornia pacifica*), an abundant plant that helps to hold the slough’s sandy banks together. Because sea otters eat the crabs, study co-author Brent Hughes, a marine ecologist at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California, and colleagues wanted to know whether the predator’s recovery would change the levels of erosion in the area.
盐沼为野生动物提供了重要的栖息地，但在全球范围内受到威胁。有几个因素，如水流增加和海平面上升，导致埃尔克霍恩斯劳的侵蚀量-估计每年约30厘米。条纹海岸蟹（厚纹蟹）也扮演了一个角色，吃泡菜（海蓬子）的根，一种丰富的植物，有助于保持斯劳的桑迪银行在一起。因为海獭吃螃蟹，研究的合着者布伦特休斯，加州罗纳特公园索诺马州立大学的海洋生态学家，和同事们想知道捕食者的恢复是否会改变该地区的侵蚀水平。

To dig into the correlation between erosion and sea otters, the team compared several lines of evidence, such as historical erosion rates in Elkhorn Slough and sea otter population trends. The researchers also did a predator-exclusion experiment, in which otters could eat burrowing crabs in some creeks but not in others. Then, they compared how much vegetation grew in each of those areas.
为了深入研究侵蚀与海獭之间的相关性，研究小组比较了几条证据线，如埃尔克霍恩斯劳的历史侵蚀率和海獭种群趋势。研究人员还做了一个捕食者排除实验，在这个实验中，水獭可以吃一些小溪中的穴居蟹，但不能吃其他小溪中的穴居蟹。然后，他们比较了这些地区的植被生长量。

## Turning the tide on erosion 扭转侵蚀的趋势

On banks where sea otters could prey on crabs, the vegetation was denser than on those from which they were excluded. Hughes says that sea otters have had a similarly positive impact on other vegetation elsewhere, such as seagrass and giant kelp. “It’s almost like, wherever they go, they’re protecting vegetation,” he says. In areas where otters had returned, erosion slowed from 30 centimetres a year to 10 centimetres a year.
在海獭可以捕食螃蟹的河岸上，植被比那些没有海獭的河岸上更密集。休斯说，海獭对其他地方的其他植被也有类似的积极影响，比如海草和巨型海藻。“这几乎就像，无论他们走到哪里，他们都在保护植被，”他说。在水獭回归的地区，侵蚀从每年30厘米减缓到每年10厘米。

As their populations increase and they reclaim their historical range, sea otters could turn the tide of erosion in other salt-marsh habitats — particularly the marshes of the nearby San Francisco Bay, Watson says.
沃森说，随着海獭种群的增加和它们恢复其历史范围，海獭可以扭转其他盐沼栖息地的侵蚀趋势--特别是附近弗朗西斯科湾的沼泽。
